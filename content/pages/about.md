# About

Hi. I'm Edgar, more often known as Guekka, G'k or G_ka. I like Nix(OS), Rust, C++, and a lot of other technologies.

My most important contribution to the software world is an automation tool called [Cathedral Assets Optimizer](https://nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316) ([source](https://github.com/Guekka/Cathedral-Assets-Optimizer/)) which is used by thousands of people. Its main purpose is helping the process of "porting" a mod between Skyrim Legendary Edition and Skyrim Special Edition.
